Micro Machines

## Where did this come from?
This is a porject that was made during the first semester of the first year of software engineering in University of Minho.
In the beginning of the semester we were presented with the proposal of recreating the old classic Micro Machines game.

## Structure
The game file system is somewhat modular. The files from *Tarefa1.hs* to *Tarefa5.hs* are basically the game's motor. The *Tarefa6.hs* codes a *BOT* that plays the game (drives itself).
